GengoTavern is a (beta) chat application that lets you create and interact with your very own characters, powered by AI. It aims to be a more Language Learning focused derivative of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern), helping casual users practice conversation with custom characters through a user-friendly interface with tools such as sentence correction, pop-up dictionaries, and grammar checkers.

1. **Input an API Key**: Head over to the ðŸ”‘ **API Tab**  for instructions
2. **Modify your Profile**: Add your name/description at the ðŸŽ­ **Persona Tab**
3. **Create a Character**: Click the âž• on the lefthand **Selection Panel**
4. **Edit your Character**: Add traits and attributes on the righthand **Edit Panel**
5. **Start Chatting**: Select your Character and Create a New Chat
