# Active Context for Development
This constantly changing file contains the current focus and active issues for the GengoTavern project, along with recent changes and upcoming considerations. It serves as a guide for developers to understand the current state of the project and what areas currently need attention.

## Recent Changes
**Group Chat Feature Development:**
The Group Chat feature is now **100% COMPLETE** ✅ including Visual Novel Mode integration!
This feature allows users to engage in group conversations with multiple characters, enhancing the interactive storytelling experience.

## Current Implementation Focus
**CSS Refactoring and UI Polish (Component-by-Component Approach):**

### 🎯 **Phase 1: CSS Organization (Low Risk)**
1. **Analyze App.css structure** and identify logical sections
2. **Split into organized files in `/src/styles/`:**
   - `styles/components/VisualNovel.css` ⭐ (preserve working sprite system!)
   - `styles/components/ChatInterface.css`
   - `styles/components/CharacterCustomization.css`
   - `styles/components/Modals.css`
   - `styles/layout/Layout.css`
   - `styles/base/Variables.css`
3. **Update component imports** and test thoroughly

### 🎯 **Phase 2: Component Polish + Icon Integration (Medium Risk)**
4. **Polish components organically** while replacing emoji placeholders:
   - **Buttons, inputs, forms** → replace ✏️📤 etc. with custom icons
   - **Chat interface** → replace 🔄⏭️× etc. with styled icons  
   - **Settings panels** → replace ⚙️📁 etc. with clean icons
   - **Create organized icon structure**: `./img/icons/chat/`, `./img/icons/ui/`, etc.
   - **Build icon system as we go** - more natural and thorough approach

**Strategy:** No external CSS frameworks (Tailwind/Heroicons) - keep full control with custom CSS and icon pack for safer, specialized language learning app optimization.

### 🎯 **Final Priority:**
**Implicit Grammar Correction Module** - Language learning features with grammar feedback
