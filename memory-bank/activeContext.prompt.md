# Active Context for Development
This constantly changing file contains the current focus and active issues for the GengoTavern project, along with recent changes and upcoming considerations. It serves as a guide for developers to understand the current state of the project and what areas currently need attention.

## Recent Changes
**Group Chat Feature Development:**
The Group Chat feature is now **100% COMPLETE** ✅ including Visual Novel Mode integration!
This feature allows users to engage in group conversations with multiple characters, enhancing the interactive storytelling experience.

## Current Implementation Focus
**CSS Refactoring and UI Polish (Component-by-Component Approach):**

### 🎯 **Phase 1: CSS Organization (Low Risk)**
1. **Analyze App.css structure** and identify logical sections
2. **Split into organized files in `/src/styles/`:**
   - `styles/components/VisualNovel.css` ⭐ (preserve working sprite system!)
   - `styles/components/ChatInterface.css`
   - `styles/components/CharacterCustomization.css`
   - `styles/components/Modals.css`
   - `styles/layout/Layout.css`
   - `styles/base/Variables.css`
3. **Update component imports** without breaking functionality:
   - Ensure all components import their respective CSS files correctly.
   - Test each component after import to verify no visual regressions.

### 🎯 **Phase 2: Component Polish + HeroIcons Integration (Medium Risk)**
4. **Replace emoji placeholders with HeroIcons**:
   - **HeroIcons**: Use SVG icons from HeroIcons for consistency and scalability.
   - **Emoji placeholders**: Replace with appropriate HeroIcons in components.
   - **Example replacements**:
     - ✏️ → PencilIcon
     - 📤 → UploadIcon
     - 🔄 → RefreshIcon
     - ⏭️ → ForwardIcon
     - × → XMarkIcon
     - ⚙️ → CogIcon
     - 📁 → FolderIcon
     - 🗑️ → TrashIcon

The 24x24 outline icons can be imported from @heroicons/react/24/outline, the 24x24 solid icons can be imported from @heroicons/react/24/solid, the 20x20 solid icons can be imported from @heroicons/react/20/solid, and 16x16 solid icons can be imported from @heroicons/react/16/solid.
Icons use an upper camel case naming convention and are always suffixed with the word Icon.
       
5. **Polish components organically** while replacing emoji placeholders:
   - **Buttons, inputs, forms** → replace ✏️📤 etc.
   - **Chat interface** → replace 🔄⏭️× etc. 
   - **Settings panels** → replace ⚙️📁 etc. 
   - **Large outline icons VS small solid icons** → use outline for large buttons, solid for small

### 🎯 **Final Priority:**
**Implicit Grammar Correction Module** - Language learning features with grammar feedback
